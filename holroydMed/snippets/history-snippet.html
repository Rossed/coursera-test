		<hr><h3>A Brief History of Memorial Ave / Chertsey St</h3>
		<h4>by Mrs Champion</h4><br>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-12"><p>"The first medical service in the Merrylands area was established by Sister Cooney, who opened a private hospital at 15 Chertsey Street (now Memorial Avenue) in 1923. Merrylands was then rural, characterised by market gardens and poultry farms, with only a few shops in the main street.</p><br></div>

<div class="col-xs-12"><p>The increasing population made it possible for the community to support a doctor in the area, and in 1926 Dr. H.T. Illingsworth (often called "Dr. Shillingsworth") set up a practice and residence at 19 Chertsey Street. The majority of the obstetrical confinements were completed in the home with a nurse in attendance. The charge for the attendance of a doctor was three pounds.</p><br>

<p>Parramatta was the medical focal point of the area, having a general hospital plus a few private hospitals. The general hospital worked on the honorary doctor system, so that whomever was on duty would provide free services for the public patients. Private patients were charged five pounds for a minor operation and a little more for the major operations.</p><br>

<p>During the depression in the early 1930's, the barter system was in full force, with the patients paying the doctors in vegetables, eggs or poultry.</p><br> 

<p>In 1928, Dr. F.H. Mc Callow bought the private hospital at No.15 Chertsey Street, Merrylands from Sister Cooney and lived and practiced from there until 1929 when he sold the practice to Dr. C.G. Champion. At this stage there were two practices in Chertsey Street.</p><br>

<p>In 1930, Dr. Illingsworth sold his practice and home to Dr. C. Swanton, who then sold to Dr. H.W. Cuthbert in early 1935.</p><br>

<p>During 1936 Dr. K.B. Shallard bought Dr. Cuthbert's practice and in 1937 bought a block of land at No. 14 Chertsey Street and built a home and surgery, moving from No. 19 which was sold to the Baptist Church.</p><br> 

<p>In 1938, Dr. C.G. Champion bought the opposition practice of Dr. Shallard, and Dr. G. Blaxland bought the house and formed a partnership with Dr. Champion.</p><br>

<p>During World War II, Dr. Blaxland was called to duty in the army and spent most of the time in New Guinea. In that time his practice was run by doctors in locum tenens. In 1946 Dr. Champion took in another partner - Dr. A. Kitchener--Smith who lived at No.15 with Dr. Champion for about 6 weeks and set up another surgery in the house. After moving to a home in another part of Chertsey Street, he continued to practice from No 15.</p><br>

<p>In 1950, after Dr. Blaxland returned from the war, his partnership and home were sold to Dr. A.H. Chancellor and he moved to Turramurra where he went into practice with his brother. Dr. Chancellor continued to practice from No. 14 Chertsey Street. In 1959, the partnership of Drs. Champion, Kitchener-Smith bought the property at No. 19 Chertsey Street where they set up The Medical Centre which is still going today."</p><br> 

<p>In recent years, as the population has increased, numerous doctors have commenced practice in the district. The principal source of this informal history is Champion family records, supplemented by oral history from residents of the district."
The succeeding doctors who joined the partnership were:</p> <br>

<p>Dr. K.W. Paver in 1954<br> 
Dr. A.S. Cumming-Thom in 1956<br> 
Dr. D.M. Cunningham in 1959<br>

Dr. A. Logan, in 1986<br> 
Dr. D. Pan in 2001<br>
Dr. M. Chircop in 2008<br></p><br>

<p>Since the time of Dr. Edwards, Holroyd Medical Practice has continued the proud tradition of providing medical services to the local community and has expanded on this in a number of ways. Various doctors have been involved in educating medical students at university level, as well as providing training for prospective General Practitioners (university graduates doing further training in General Practice). Several of us are involved in various committees at local hospitals, and are actively involved in providing educational and training opportunities to General Practitioners within the Holroyd district.</p>
